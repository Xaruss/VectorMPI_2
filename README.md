# VectorMPI_2
The program uses MPI to calculate the sum of elements in an n-dimensional vector of real numbers in parallel, in an environment where the relationship between processes (processors) is established using the MPI_Graph_Create function, and the defined structure is in the form of a ring (ring architecture n = 4) with 4 processes.
